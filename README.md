# shufflify
A better (more random) shuffle generator than the one by Spotify.

## Spotify deprecated implicit grants
Shufflify will probably stop working in November 2025 because [Spotify removes the authentication mechanism](https://developer.spotify.com/blog/2025-02-12-increasing-the-security-requirements-for-integrating-with-spotify) the application uses. I can't be bothered to update it since I don't use Shufflify anymore. If you need some better shuffle take a look at https://github.com/syeo66/go-shufflify
