# shufflify
A better (more random) shuffle generator than the one by Spotify.

## Spotify deprecated implicit grants
Shufflify will probably stop working in November 2025 because Spotify removes the authentication mechanism the application uses. I can't be bothered to update it since I don't use Shufflify anymore. If you need some better shuffle take a look at https://github.com/syeo66/go-shufflify
